  Name: "Vogelkop Superb Bird-of-Paradise \u2014 The Smiling Dancer"
  Description: "This tiny bird from the Vogelkop Peninsula of New Guinea may be small,
    but it puts on one of the most incredible performances in the animal kingdom.
    When it\u2019s time to impress a female, the male transforms: it flares its jet-black
    feathers into a wide oval shape, framed with a neon-blue edge, forming what looks
    like a glowing cartoon smiley face. As he dances, he hops from side to side with
    quick, jerky motions, producing clicking and buzzing sounds. The performance
    is perfectly choreographed, designed to hold the female\u2019s attention \u2014
    and it works. Scientists only recently confirmed that the Vogelkop Superb is
    a distinct species, separate from its close cousin. And with its unique smile-shaped
    display, it\u2019s become a symbol of just how creative and weird evolution can
    get. "
