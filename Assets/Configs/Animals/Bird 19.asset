  Name: "Snowy Owl \u2014 The Arctic Ghost"
  Description: "The Snowy Owl is one of the most iconic birds in the world \u2014
    not just because of its starring role in Harry Potter, but because of its stunning
    beauty. Covered in thick, white feathers that blend perfectly with the snowy
    tundra, this owl is built for extreme cold. Males are almost entirely white,
    while females and younger owls have dark markings. Unlike most owls, Snowy Owls
    are active during the day, making them easier to spot in their wide-open Arctic
    habitat. They sit silently on the ground or snowbanks, scanning for prey like
    lemmings and other small mammals, which they hunt with powerful precision. With
    piercing yellow eyes and silent wings, the Snowy Owl is both elegant and fierce
    \u2014 a true ghost of the north, surviving where few other birds can. "
