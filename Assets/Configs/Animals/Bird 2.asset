  Name: "Hoatzin \u2014 The Leaf-Eating Stinkbird "
  Description: "The Hoatzin is one of the strangest birds in the world. Native to
    the Amazon rainforest, it looks like a punk rocker with its spiky crest, blue
    face, and red eyes. But its most surprising feature isn\u2019t its looks \u2014
    it\u2019s its diet. The Hoatzin is one of the only birds that eats mostly leaves,
    and it digests them using a special fermentation process, like cows do. This
    leafy diet makes the Hoatzin smell pretty bad \u2014 which is why locals often
    call it the \u201Cstinkbird.\u201D But the weirdness doesn\u2019t stop there:
    when Hoatzin chicks are born, they have tiny claws on their wings! These claws
    help them climb through branches and escape predators before they can fly. Hoatzins
    live in noisy groups near rivers and swamps, and they\u2019re clumsy flyers,
    often crashing through foliage. Scientists are still puzzled by their evolutionary
    path \u2014 some even believe they could be a link to ancient bird species. Strange,
    smelly, and totally unique \u2014 the Hoatzin is a true jungle oddball. "
