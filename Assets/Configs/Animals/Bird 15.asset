  Name: "Mandarin Duck \u2014 The Living Painting"
  Description: "The Mandarin Duck is often called the most beautiful duck in the
    world \u2014 and one glance explains why. Native to East Asia, the male boasts
    an incredible palette of colors: bright orange \"sails\" on its back, green and
    purple head feathers, white stripes, and a coral-red bill. It looks like it walked
    out of a watercolor painting. These ducks are symbols of love and fidelity in
    many Asian cultures, especially in China and Japan, where they\u2019re often
    given as wedding gifts or featured in art. This reputation isn\u2019t just legend
    \u2014 Mandarin Ducks are known to form strong pair bonds during the breeding
    season. In recent years, wild populations have also appeared in Europe and North
    America, where escaped ornamental ducks have established themselves. Whether
    in a palace pond or a city park, a Mandarin Duck is guaranteed to turn heads. "
