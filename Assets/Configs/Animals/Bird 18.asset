  Name: "Wilson\u2019s Bird-of-Paradise \u2014 The Neon Performer "
  Description: "Wilson\u2019s Bird-of-Paradise might be one of the smallest in its
    family, but it\u2019s also one of the most breathtaking. Found only on a few
    islands in Indonesia, the male sports an electric-blue crown that looks painted
    on, a glowing yellow collar, emerald green breast feathers, and two spiral tail
    wires that curl like ribbons. When it\u2019s time to impress a mate, the male
    clears a special patch of forest floor \u2014 sweeping away every leaf \u2014
    to create a perfect display stage. There, he performs a dance that includes hopping,
    wing-flashing, and head-bobbing in flawless rhythm. With its glowing colors and
    precise moves, Wilson\u2019s Bird-of-Paradise feels almost unreal \u2014 a tiny,
    pixel-perfect performer hidden deep in the rainforest. "
