  Name: "Potoo \u2014 The Living Tree Branch "
  Description: "The Potoo is one of nature\u2019s greatest masters of disguise. Found
    across Central and South America, this nocturnal bird spends its days perched
    motionless on tree stumps or branches, blending in so perfectly that it's nearly
    impossible to spot. With its mottled gray-brown feathers and stiff posture, it
    looks exactly like a broken limb. At night, the Potoo comes alive. It hunts insects
    using its enormous mouth, which opens wider than you\u2019d expect from its sleepy
    daytime look. Its giant yellow eyes help it see in the dark, and its ghostly,
    echoing calls give it an eerie presence in the forest. Despite its spooky vibe,
    the Potoo is harmless and mysterious \u2014 a quiet bird that prefers solitude
    and shadows. Many people go their whole lives without realizing they've passed
    right by one. "
