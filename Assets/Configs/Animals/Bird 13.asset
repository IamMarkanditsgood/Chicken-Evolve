  Name: "Andean Cock-of-the-rock \u2014 The Cloud Forest Showman "
  Description: "The Andean Cock-of-the-rock is a bold and charismatic bird that lives
    in the misty cloud forests of the Andes Mountains. The male is impossible to
    miss: bright orange from head to belly, with a huge, rounded crest that looks
    like a pompadour hairstyle straight out of a rock concert. During mating season,
    males gather at leks (display arenas) and compete for attention through a mix
    of hopping, wing-fluttering, and sharp, barking calls. It\u2019s loud, chaotic,
    and full of drama \u2014 just the way these birds like it. Despite their eye-catching
    look, these birds are quite shy outside of mating season and stick to dense,
    mossy forests. For birdwatchers, spotting one in the wild is like seeing a living
    jewel flash out of the mist. "
