  Name: "Raggiana Bird-of-Paradise \u2014 The Jungle\u2019s Firework "
  Description: "The Raggiana Bird-of-Paradise is the national bird of Papua New Guinea,
    and it\u2019s easy to see why. With flowing plumes of bright orange, yellow,
    and crimson, the male puts on a dazzling display that feels more like a firework
    than a bird. During courtship, males gather in special group areas called leks,
    where they compete through synchronized dances, wing-flutters, and loud calls
    to impress watching females. Their ornate feathers sway and shimmer like living
    flames in the jungle canopy. Beyond its beauty, the Raggiana holds deep cultural
    importance for local communities, appearing in traditional dress, stories, and
    ceremonies. It\u2019s not just a bird \u2014 it\u2019s a symbol of pride, identity,
    and the wild magic of New Guinea\u2019s rainforests. "
