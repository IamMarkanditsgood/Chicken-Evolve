  Name: "Kea \u2014 The Mischievous Mountain Parrot "
  Description: "The Kea is a highly intelligent alpine parrot that lives in the mountainous
    regions of New Zealand. With its olive-green feathers and bright orange underwings,
    it may not look flashy at first glance \u2014 but don\u2019t be fooled. This
    bird is one of the smartest and most playful species on the planet. Kea are curious
    by nature and love to explore, problem-solve, and interact with people (sometimes
    a bit too much). They've been caught unscrewing rooftop bolts, stealing snacks,
    and even opening trash bins and car doors. In the wild, they use tools, play
    games, and learn from each other \u2014 making them true feathered tricksters.
    Despite their fun personalities, Kea are a protected species. Their numbers have
    declined due to human conflicts and habitat loss. But efforts are underway to
    protect this cheeky genius of the mountains \u2014 a bird as clever as it is
    chaotic. "
