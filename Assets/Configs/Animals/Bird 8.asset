  Name: "Tawny Frogmouth \u2014 The Owl That Isn\u2019t "
  Description: "At first glance, the Tawny Frogmouth looks like an owl \u2014 but
    it\u2019s not! Native to Australia, this bird belongs to a completely different
    family and has its own quirky charm. Its name comes from its wide, frog-like
    beak, which it uses to catch insects and small critters during nighttime hunts.
    By day, the Tawny Frogmouth transforms into a stick. Seriously \u2014 it stretches
    its body, closes its eyes, and freezes on tree branches, blending in perfectly
    with bark. This camouflage is so effective that many predators never notice it
    at all. These birds are peaceful and a little goofy, often seen in pairs or family
    groups. Their soft grunts and sleepy expressions have made them beloved in Australia
    \u2014 they even won the country\u2019s Bird of the Year award in 2021! "
