  Name: "Secretary Bird \u2014 The Snake Stomper of Africa "
  Description: "The Secretary Bird is one of the most unusual birds of prey on Earth.
    Found across the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa, it looks like a majestic eagle
    perched on stilt-like legs \u2014 blending the power of a raptor with the stride
    of a stork. Its name comes from the long black feathers on its head, which reminded
    early observers of quill pens tucked behind a secretary\u2019s ear. What really
    makes the Secretary Bird famous is its hunting technique: it kills snakes by
    stomping on them with incredible speed and force. With sharp talons and lightning-fast
    kicks, it can take down venomous snakes like cobras with ease \u2014 making it
    a legend among snake hunters. Though it has strong wings, the Secretary Bird
    prefers to hunt on foot, striding gracefully across open grasslands. It's a symbol
    of elegance and danger, earning a place as a national emblem in several African
    countries \u2014 and definitely one of the most striking bird species in the
    world. "
