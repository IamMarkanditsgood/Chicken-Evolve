  Name: "Bearded Vulture \u2014 The Bone-Eater of the Skies "
  Description: "The Bearded Vulture, also known as the Lammergeier, is one of the
    most mysterious and dramatic-looking raptors in the world. Found in high mountains
    across Europe, Asia, and Africa, it feeds mostly on bones \u2014 yes, bones!
    It carries them into the air and drops them onto rocks to crack them open and
    get to the nutritious marrow inside. Its name comes from the dark \u201Cbeard\u201D
    of feathers under its chin, but what really makes it striking is its fiery appearance.
    Bearded Vultures often stain their white feathers red by bathing in iron-rich
    soil \u2014 scientists believe this could be a form of social signaling or intimidation.
    Despite its fearsome habits, the Bearded Vulture is peaceful and doesn\u2019t
    hunt live prey. It's a high-flying scavenger with a gothic look and a taste for
    calcium \u2014 truly one of nature\u2019s strangest survival specialists. "
