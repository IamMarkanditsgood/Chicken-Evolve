  Name: "Jacana \u2014 The Bird That Walks on Water"
  Description: "Nicknamed the \"Jesus bird,\" the Jacana is famous for its ability
    to appear as if it\u2019s walking on water. This illusion comes from its incredibly
    long toes, which spread its weight across floating vegetation like lily pads.
    You can find Jacanas in tropical wetlands around the world, including Central
    and South America, Africa, and Asia. Jacanas flip traditional bird roles: females
    are larger, more territorial, and mate with several males. Meanwhile, the males
    take care of the nest and raise the chicks \u2014 a rare role reversal in the
    bird world. These elegant little birds aren\u2019t just curious-looking \u2014
    they\u2019re also agile and resourceful. With their striking colors, clever parenting
    strategy, and literal water-walking abilities, Jacanas are truly one of nature\u2019s
    most surprising oddballs. "
