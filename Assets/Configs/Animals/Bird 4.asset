  Name: "Resplendent Quetzal \u2014 The Emerald Spirit of the Forest "
  Description: "The Resplendent Quetzal is one of the most breathtaking birds in
    the world. Found in the cloud forests of Central America, it\u2019s especially
    famous in Guatemala, where it\u2019s a national symbol and even featured on the
    currency. Males have brilliant green plumage, a bright red chest, and flowing
    tail feathers that can be longer than their body. In ancient Mayan and Aztec
    cultures, the quetzal was seen as a sacred creature representing freedom and
    the divine. Killing one was forbidden \u2014 instead, its feathers were carefully
    collected for royal robes and ceremonial headdresses. Quetzals feed mostly on
    fruit, especially wild avocados, and nest in tree holes. Despite their beauty,
    they are shy and elusive in the wild, often hiding high among the misty branches.
    To spot one is a rare and magical experience \u2014 a living jewel in the heart
    of the rainforest. "
