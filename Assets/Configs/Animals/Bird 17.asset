  Name: "Long-wattled Umbrellabird \u2014 The Jungle's Thunder Voice "
  Description: "The Long-wattled Umbrellabird is a rare and unforgettable sight in
    the rainforests of Ecuador and Colombia. Males have a large, umbrella-shaped
    crest that drapes over their beak like a feathered hat \u2014 but the real showstopper
    is the long, inflatable wattle hanging from their chest, sometimes nearly as
    long as their body! During mating season, this throat wattle inflates like a
    balloon and helps produce deep, booming calls that echo through the forest. The
    sound is low, powerful, and can be heard from far away \u2014 almost like a jungle
    bass drum. These birds prefer to stay hidden high in the canopy, and their unusual
    looks help them stand out when it's time to attract a mate. Strange, stylish,
    and loud \u2014 the Long-wattled Umbrellabird is nature\u2019s goth rock frontman
    with a built-in sound system "
