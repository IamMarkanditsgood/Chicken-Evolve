  Name: "Harpy Eagle \u2014 The Jungle\u2019s Winged Powerhouse "
  Description: "The Harpy Eagle is one of the largest and most powerful birds of
    prey in the world. Found in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America,
    it has striking features: massive talons the size of a bear's claws, bold black-and-white
    plumage, and a fierce crown of feathers atop its head. It truly looks like a
    mythological creature come to life. Harpy Eagles specialize in hunting monkeys,
    sloths, and large birds high in the forest canopy. With incredible strength and
    agility, they can swoop silently through the trees and snatch prey in midair.
    Their talons are so strong, they can crush bone instantly. Despite their dominance
    in the sky, Harpy Eagles are rare and threatened by deforestation. As rainforest
    guardians, they play a crucial role in keeping ecosystems in balance. Mysterious,
    regal, and awe-inspiring \u2014 the Harpy Eagle is the king of the canopy. "
