  Name: "Great Argus \u2014 The Peacock of the Jungle "
  Description: "The Great Argus is a spectacular pheasant native to the rainforests
    of Southeast Asia. While its body may seem modest at first glance, the male\u2019s
    wings are the real stars \u2014 each one stretches over a meter long and is covered
    in hundreds of \u201Ceye-like\u201D spots, creating one of the most mesmerizing
    displays in the bird world. During courtship, the male clears a performance space
    on the forest floor and fans out his wings like a living mural. As he dances
    and spins, the eyespots shimmer and ripple \u2014 a hypnotic show designed to
    win a mate. Its name comes from Argus Panoptes, the giant from Greek mythology
    with a hundred eyes. Fitting, because when the Great Argus performs, it truly
    feels like the forest is watching. "
