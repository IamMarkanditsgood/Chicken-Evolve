  Name: "Helmeted Hornbill \u2014 The Warrior of the Rainforest "
  Description: "The Helmeted Hornbill is one of the most unusual and ancient-looking
    birds in the world. Native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia, it gets
    its name from the solid casque \u2014 a helmet-like structure on top of its massive
    beak. Unlike other hornbills, this casque is made of dense, ivory-like keratin.
    During the breeding season, males engage in dramatic aerial battles, crashing
    into each other mid-air using their casques like battering rams. The loud collisions
    echo through the jungle and are part of their fight for territory and mates.
    Tragically, this bird is critically endangered. Its casque has become a target
    for illegal wildlife trade, sold as \u201Cred ivory.\u201D But in the wild, the
    Helmeted Hornbill remains a symbol of strength, age, and mystery \u2014 a forest
    warrior with a prehistoric soul. "
